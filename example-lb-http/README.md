# HTTP Load Balancer Example

This example creates a global HTTP forwarding rule to forward traffic to instance groups in the us-west1 and us-east1 regions.

## Set up the environment

```
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

## Run Terraform

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Open URL of load balancer in browser:

```
EXTERNAL_IP=$(terraform output -module gce-lb-http | grep external_ip | cut -d = -f2 | xargs echo -n)
(until curl -sf -o /dev/null http://${EXTERNAL_IP}; do echo "Waiting for Load Balancer... "; sleep 5 ; done) && open http://${EXTERNAL_IP}
```

> Wait for all instance to become healthy per output of: `gcloud compute backend-services get-health group-http-lb-backend-0 --global`

You should see the instance details from the region closest to you.

### Test balancing to other region

Resize the instance group of your closest region to cause traffic to flow to the other group.

If you are getting traffic from `group1` (us-west1) from `http://${EXTERNAL_IP}`, scale group 1 to 0 instances:

```
TF_VAR_group1_size=0 terraform apply
```

Otherwise scale group 2 (us-east1) to 0 instances:

```
TF_VAR_group2_size=0 terraform apply
```

Open the external IP again and verify you see traffic from the other group:

```
open http://${EXTERNAL_IP}
```

> It may take several minutes for the global load balancer to be created and the backends to register.

## Cleanup

Remove all resources created by terraform:

```
terraform destroy
```
